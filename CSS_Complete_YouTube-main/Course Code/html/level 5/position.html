<!-- 
The CSS position property determines how an element is positioned within a document, 
allowing it to be taken out of the normal document flow or to be offset from its default location.

The default value is static, which means the element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, 
and properties like top, right, bottom, left, and z-index have no effect.

When set to relative, an element is offset from its normal position based on top, right, bottom, and left values, 
but it still occupies its original space in the layout, and the offset does not affect other elements.

For absolute positioning, the element is removed from the normal flow, and its final position is determined relative to 
its closest positioned ancestor (or the initial containing block if none exists), with no space left for it in the layout.

fixed positioning also removes the element from the normal flow, positioning it relative to the viewport (browser window),
so it remains in place during scrolling.

sticky positioning combines aspects of relative and fixed behavior; the element is treated as relative until it crosses a 
specified threshold (defined by top, right, bottom, or left), at which point it becomes fixed within its containing block 
until it reaches the edge of that block.
