<!--
if two elements overlaps, z-index decides which one is on top.
    
The CSS z-index property controls the stacking order of positioned elements and their descendants, including 
flex and grid items, along the z-axis, determining which elements appear in front of or behind others when they overlap.

It only applies to elements with a position value other than static, such as absolute, relative, fixed, sticky, or 
those that are direct children of a display: flex container.

Elements with a higher z-index value are stacked on top of those with a lower value; for example, an element with 
z-index:5 will appear in front of one with z-index: 3.

The z-index property can accept integer values, including negative numbers to place elements behind others, 
or the keyword auto, which sets the stack level to 0 and does not create a new stacking context.
